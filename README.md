## ⚙️ How It Works
The Customer-Segmentation application uses advanced clustering algorithms to analyze patterns in your data. The K-Means algorithm groups customers based on similarities in spending, while DBSCAN detects clusters in noisy data. This dual approach provides you with reliable insights.

1. **Data Preparation**: Data is cleaned and prepared for analysis.
2. **Clustering**: The application applies K-Means and DBSCAN to identify customer segments.
3. **Visualization**: Results are shown using clear graphs and charts, making it easy to understand.

## 📊 Sample Data Structure
To use the application effectively, your input CSV file should have the following columns:

- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer
- **Age**: Age of the customer
- **Annual Income**: Yearly income of the customer
- **Spending Score**: Score assigned by the mall based on customer spending behavior

Sample CSV:

```
CustomerID,Age,Annual Income (k$),Spending Score
1,23,40,52
2,45,60,78
3,34,80,86
```
